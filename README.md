# Tableau--HR-Analytics-Dashboard

The project aims at helping an organization to improve employee performance and improve employee retention rate (reduce attirtion) by creating a HR Analytics Dashboard.

The KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) including Overall Employee Count, Attrition Count , Attrition Rate, Active Employees, Avg. Age provide a concise overview of the dashboard.

Comparative Analysis: Analyzing factors Contributing to Attrition

Department wise Attrition: 
a. The pie chart illustrates how attrition is distributed among different departments within the organization. Each slice of the pie represents a department, and the size of each slice is proportional to the percentage of attrition in that department.

b. The chart allows you to easily compare attrition rates between departments. You can see at a glance which departments have a higher or lower attrition rate relative to others.

c. Departmental Focus: It helps in identifying departments with high attrition rates, drawing attention to areas that may require further investigation or interventions to improve employee retention.

d. By viewing the chart, you can also determine the overall attrition rate for the organization by summing up the percentages of all departments.

No. of Employees by Age Group: This frequency chart provides insights into the distribution of employees across various age groups within the organization. This visualization helps in understanding the demographic composition of the workforce. 

Job Statisfaction Rating: 
a. The matrix chart displays satisfaction ratings, usually in the form of colors or numeric values, representing the varying levels of satisfaction.

b. Comparative Analysis - Users can quickly compare satisfaction levels among different categories, identifying areas with high and low satisfaction.

c. Identifying Patterns - Patterns in satisfaction become apparent, helping users recognize trends or correlations that may exist across different dimensions.

d. Heatmap Representation -The use of color gradients or intensity in the matrix provides an at-a-glance view of satisfaction levels, with darker colors often indicating higher satisfaction.

Educational Field Wise Attrition: provides a holistic view of attrition trends based on employees' educational backgrounds. This information is valuable for HR professionals and organizational leaders in making informed decisions related to talent management, workforce planning, and employee retention strategies.

Attrtion Rate by Gender for different groups: 

a. The donut chart segments represent attrition rates for different genders (e.g., male and female), offering a visual comparison of attrition levels.

b. The chart further breaks down each gender segment into different age groups, allowing for a detailed analysis of attrition patterns across varying career stages.

c. The visualization helps in tailoring retention strategies based on the identified attrition trends, considering the unique needs and expectations of employees in different demographic groups.
